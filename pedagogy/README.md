# 1.1 FOCUS AREA:

#### Optics 

# 1.2 About the Experiment:
Lens can diverge and converge the ray of light. Whenever a ray of light fall on lens it’s  formed  real and virtual image. by the lens formula we can find the image distance.
### Lens formula –(1/u)+(1/v)=(1/f)
**u= object distance**

**v=image distance**

**f=focal length**

### According image distance and focal length of lens find distance and nature of image .
#### For the convex lens nature of image **:-**
1. At infinity

2. Beyond 2F

3. At 2F
 
4. Between F and 2F

5. At the focus F

6. Between the focus F and optical centre C

#### For the concave lens nature of image –

1. At infinity

2. Between infinity and optical centre

## 2.3 Description of sections:
In order to find the the image distance for varrying object distance and show the nature of image  using concave and convex lens.

First of all we know two factor:

1.image distance

2.focal length of lens

Using the lens famula  find the image distance
**(1/u)+(1/v)=(1/f)**

#### u=object distance
#### v=image distance
#### f=focal length
### one example of  image formation:
![image](images/case6.jpg)
 
## Result:
**1**. Give the image distance
**2**. Nature of image formation
**3**. Graph of ‘u’ and ‘v’
#### CALCULATION:

Calculate the image distance by object distance in the graph
