# 1.1 FOCUS AREA: Optics 
# 1.2 About the Experiment:lens can diverge and converge the ray of light. Whenever a ray of light fall on lens it’s  formed  real and virtual image. by the lens formula we can find the image distance.
### Lens formula –(1/u)+(1/v)=(1/f)
**u= object distance**

**v=image distance**

**f=focal length**

### According image distance and focal length of lens find distance and nature of image .
#### For the convex lens nature of image **:-**
1. At infinity

2. Beyond 2F

3. At 2F
 
4. Between F and 2F

5. At the focus F

6. Between the focus F and optical centre C

#### For the concave lens nature of image –

1. At infinity

2. Between infinity and optical centre

2.3 Description of sections:in order to find the the image distance for varrying object distance and show the nature of image  using concave and convex lens.
First of all we know two factor:
1.image distance
2.focal length of lens
Using the lens famula  find the image distance
(1/u)+(1/v)=(1/f)
u=object distance
v=image distance
f=focal length
one example of  image formation:

 
Result:1.give the image distance
           2. nature of image formation
3.graph of ‘u’ and ‘v’
CALCULATION: 
Calculate the image distance by object distance in the graph
