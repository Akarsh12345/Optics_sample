# Principle:

For obtaining images formed by convex lens/concave lens, rules are three types:-

**(i)** A ray of light which is parallel to the parallel axis passes through the focus(convex lens)or appears to be coming from focus(Concave lens) after the refraction of light.

**(ii)** A ray of light passing through the optical centre of the convex or concave lens goes straight after refraction.

**(iii)** When a ray of light passes through the focus of convex lens or seems to coming from focus of concave lens, becomes parallel to the principlal axis .


# Theory:-

## Lens:-

The lens is a combination of two or more simple glasses that converges or diverges the ray of light.Two main types of lenses are:- (i) Convex lens (ii) Concave lens

**(i)**  **Convex lens**

It converges the ray of light so it is also called converging lens.These lenses are thicker at middle and thinner at the edges.


**(ii)**  **Concave lens**

It diverges the ray of light so it is also called diverging lens. These are thnner at middle and thicker at the edges.

Lens Formula:

## (1÷v)-(1÷u)=1÷f

## (1÷v)=(1÷u)+(1÷f)

## (1÷v)=(u+f)÷(uf)

## v=(u*f)÷(u+f)
